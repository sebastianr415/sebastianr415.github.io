                My intentions are to learn and keep track of my journey.

                helpful tips for any programming langauge. LinkedIn is used to connect with peers I've met personally or through mutual job descriptions.

        <p>
            In the form above I had written javascript for the user to correctly fill in the boxes. When the user clicks on submit a function will run
            an if else statement. If the user submits the boxes incorrectly an alert message will appear. If the user fills the boxes correctly the else statement will run 
            without sending and alert.
